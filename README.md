# sicp-racket-solution

I post my solutions for the exercises from
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
in this _repository_. Some exercises requires writing
procedures. For that ones this _repository_ also contains
tests for some of the solutions. 

`$ racket test/chapter-1/*`
This command will run all tests files for all of the
solutions for the first chapter exercises.

`$ racket test/chapter-1/exercise-1.03-test.rkt`
This command will run tests for exercise 1.1.3.

Solutions for other exercises contain some comments and
source code either.
