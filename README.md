# SICP exercises solved on Racket
## racket-sicp

I post my solutions for the exercises from
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
in this _repository_. Some exercises require writing
procedures. For that ones this _repository_ also contains
tests for some of the solutions.

SICP on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).

SICP's text online [HTML](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

Requires [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) installed to run programs (Distribution: Racket, not Minimal Racket if you want to run tests).

`raco test test/chapter-1/*`
This command will run all tests files for all of the
solutions for the first chapter exercises.

`raco test test/chapter-1/exercise-1.03-test.rkt`
This command will run tests for exercise 1.3.

`make test` - runs all tests.

Solutions for exercises with no tests contain some comments and
source code either.
