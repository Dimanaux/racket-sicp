; Exercise 1.9.
; Each of the following two procedures defines a method for
; adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures
; inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which
; decrements its argument by 1.
; Using the substitution model, illustrate the process
; generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5).
; Are these processes iterative or recursive?
